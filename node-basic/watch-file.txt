NodeJs is asynchronous, single threaded, non-blocking i/o model. Though it is asynchronous, it is efficient because it uses non-locking event loop and keeps the events in a stack which are executed one by one without waiting for anyone of htese to finish, instead they will be executed and completed as the process is running other callbacks.
